Abstract

Corals that can resist bleaching, survive without algal endosymbionts lost during bleaching, and effectively recover symbiont populations after heat stress are more likely to persist and reproduce in future warmer ocean climates. However, it is imperative to determine whether stress tolerant corals have reduced fitness attributed to other traits and how these patterns of resilience are inherited across generations. We investigated growth under ambient conditions and bleaching resistance and recovery in a model population of adult Montipora capitata and an F1 generation produced from reproductive crosses of a subset of colonies. We found a positive relationship between thermal tolerance and growth in adults, where moderately tolerant corals had the highest baseline growth, suggesting a nuanced tradeoff between traits. Highly tolerant adults were also more likely to survive during recovery, suggesting limited tradeoffs between resistance and resilience. Conversely, there was no relationship between growth and thermal tolerance in juvenile corals, partly because juvenile heat tolerance was heritable, while growth rate was not, suggesting different mechanisms governing energetic tradeoffs across life-history stages. These results provide further insight into tradeoffs and the adaptive capacity of heat tolerant corals in the Anthropocene.
